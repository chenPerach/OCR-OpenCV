## OCR-OpenCV
this is a very simple Open-CV project for [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)
it was written in C++ and CMake using [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and [Open-CV](https://opencv.org).

the project isn't very complicated and was used mostly for testing the use of CMake for linking and compiling CPP projects
